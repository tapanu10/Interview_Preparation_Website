             <p>A good resume is your key to getting that dream job. Your resume serves as an introduction<br>

             </br>
              <p>The goal of a resume is to capture the attention of hiring managers and recruiters, encouraging them to invite you for an interview. It's important to tailor your resume for each job application, emphasizing the most relevant<br></br> experiences and skills that align with the specific requirements of the position. </p>
